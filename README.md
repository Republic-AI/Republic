## üõ† Setup

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js v18+ (for local development only)
- Python 3.8+ (for local development only)
- API Keys:
  - OpenAI API key (required for GPT models)
  - Anthropic API key (optional for Claude models)
  - Platform-specific API keys (as needed)

### API Key Configuration

There are two ways to configure API keys:

1. **Node Configuration (Recommended)**
   - Each AI agent node has a dedicated API key field in its configuration
   - API keys are stored securely and used only for specific nodes
   - Configure keys in node settings under "AI Model Configuration"
   - Supports per-node API key rotation and management

2. **Environment Variables (Alternative)**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key_here
   ```
   - These will be used as fallback if no API key is provided in node configuration
   - Supports global API key management

Note: For security, API keys in node configurations are encrypted at rest and masked in the UI.

### Installation

#### Option 1: Using Docker (Recommended)

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Republic-AI/Republic.git
cd republic
```

2.  **Set up environment variables:**

    *   Create a `.env` file in the `node-llm-service/` directory.
    *   Add your API keys to the `.env` file, following the example in `node-llm-service/.env`.  **Important:**  Replace the placeholder values with your actual API keys.  For example:

        ```
        OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
        TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN=your_twitter_bearer_token
        SOLANA_RPC_URL=your_solana_rpc_url
        ```
    *   You may also need to set `TWITTER_RAPIDAPI_KEY` in your `.env` file if you are using a RapidAPI proxy for Twitter access.

3.  **Build and run the application:**

```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

    This command will build the Docker images for the frontend and backend and start the containers.

4.  **Access the application:**

    Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Multi-Agent Examples
